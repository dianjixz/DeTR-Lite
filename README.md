# DeTR-Lite
A simple version of DeTR

## Before you enjoy this DeTR-Lite
The purpose of this project is to allow you to learn the basic knowledge of DeTR. 
Perfectly reproducing DeTR is not my goal because of the high demand for computing resources.

The input size used by the official DeTR is 800x1333, but my device is 
not enough to support such a large input size, so I adjusted it to 640x640.

The project can now train and eval my DeTR-Lite, 
but it is uncertain whether the desired effect can be achieved, 
and whether there are potential bugs has not yet been discovered.

The writing of the project code is in progress ...
